I am an Assistant Professor in the [CST Department](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/computer-systems/) at the [City University of New York](https://www.cuny.edu/). I completed my postdoctoral fellowship in the [Department of Information and Computer Science](https://www.ics.hawaii.edu) at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. I received my Ph.D. in Computing and Information Sciences from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), where I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Global Cyber Security Institute](https://www.rit.edu/cybersecurity/) under the supervision of [Dr.Mehdi Mirakhorli](https://www.se.rit.edu/~mehdi/). I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Shiraz University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/en/home)
I have served as a research collaborator with the [National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST)](https://samate.nist.gov/BF/Team/index.html).

<h2> Research Interests</h2>
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of software security and large language models, with a focus on:
